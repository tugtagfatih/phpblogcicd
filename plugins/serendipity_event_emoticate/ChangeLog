   UPGRADE NOTES:
     Due to a changed fallback behaviour in Serendipity 2.0+
     for frontend and backend templates you need to this:

     If you already have you own emoticons.inc.php file, living
     in /templates/yourTemplate/*, you need to change all occurrences
     of
       serendipity_getTemplateFile('img/emoticons/yoursmiley.png')
     to 
       serendipity_getTemplateFile('img/emoticons/yoursmiley.png', 'serendipityHTTPPath', true)

     The distinction of Backend and Frontend themes in Serendipity 2.0 will try
     to search for a file in the backend-directory of a theme,
     or use the default template (which currently is 2k11),
     because backend screens live normally in a themes /admin directory,
     not in other frontends.
